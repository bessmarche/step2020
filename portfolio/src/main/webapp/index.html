      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
      <p>It's-a-me, Beatrice!<br>I am a  <b>STEP Intern</b> in the Plx ZRH team. I was born and raised in <b>Italy</b> and I’ve been living in the UK for the past 5 years.<br>
        Currently, I am a 2nd year undergrad reading <b>Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford University</b> (so if you have any deep philosophical questions fire away! ).<br> 
        In my spare time I enjoy <b>horse riding, hiking, playing board games and baking</b> (chocolate cake anyone?). This is my first work experience and I'm so excited to be working for Google!</p>

            <h1>My CS background</h1>
            I’ve started studying CS at university.<br>

            The languages I have used include Scala, Haskell (love it), and Python.<br>
            I haven’t done any major projects but I like doing Hackatons and coding with my friends.<br>
            <h1><i>"It's not a bug, it's a feature!"</i></h1>
            Here is a random assortment of things I can do. Are they a bug? Are they a feature? It's up to you to decide :) <br>
            <br>
            I like coding (obviously), I am familiar with the following languages: Python, Haskell, Scala, JS, html and CSS<br>
            I also like studying philosophy. My favourite field is Philosophy of Logic and Language<br>
            I've been riding horses since I was a child, currently I am the Novice Captain of my university team<br>
