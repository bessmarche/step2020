        <h1>Hello world!</h1>
        <h2><i>It's-a-me, Beatrice!</i></h2>
        <p>
          I am a <b>STEP Intern</b> in the Plx ZRH
          team. I was born and raised in <b>Italy</b> and I’ve been living in
          the UK for the past 5 years.<br />
          Currently, I am a 2nd year undergrad reading
          <b>Computer Science and Philosophy at Oxford University</b> (so if you
          have any deep philosophical questions fire away!).<br />
          In my spare time I enjoy
          <b>horse riding, hiking, playing board games and baking</b> (chocolate
          cake anyone?). This is my first work experience and I'm so excited to
          be working for Google!

        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
        Born and raised in Italy.<br />
        Have been living in the UK for 5 years.<br />
        Studying CS and Philosophy at the University of Oxford.<br />
        When not coding you can find me horse riding.<br />
        </p>
        <h1>My CS background</h1>
        <p>
        I’ve started studying CS at university.<br />
        The topics I’ve covered include Functional Programming, Object Oriented
        Programming, Algs and Data Structures, Logic and Models of Computations
        The languages I have used include Scala, Haskell (love it), and
        Python.<br />
        I haven’t done any major projects but I like doing Hackatons and coding
        with my friends.<br />
        </p>
        <h1><i>"It's not a bug, it's a feature!"</i></h1>
        Here is a random assortment of things I can do. Are they a bug? Are they
        a feature? It's up to you to decide :) <br />
        <br />
        <p>
        I like coding (obviously), I am familiar with the following languages:
        Python, Haskell, Scala, JS, html and CSS<br />
        I also like studying philosophy. My favourite field is Philosophy of
        Logic and Language<br />
        I've been riding horses since I was a child, currently I am the Novice
        Captain of my university team<br />
        More coming soon!

          <h1> When in Rome </h1>
          <p>
           As part of my internship I need to learn about libraries that provide access to various
features of Google Cloud. 
           On this page I've explored different features of Google Maps library, which lets you add an
interactive Google Map to a webpage.
          </p>
          <h2><i>"Oh Rome! My country! City of the soul!" - Lord Byron</i></h2>
          <p>
          You've probably heard of some of Rome most famous landmarks, like the
          Collosseum or St. Peter Basilica on this map you'll find some "hidden
          gems" of the Eternal City.<br />
          These are some of my favourite places to grab a snack, I hope next
          time you'll visit Rome you'll stop by and check them out.

        As part of my internship I need to learn about libraries that provide access to various
features of Google Cloud. 
        On this page I've explored different features of Google Charts library, which lets you add an
interactive chart to a webpage. 
        <br>
        I've taken this opportunity to settle once and for all the age-old question <b> "what is the best pizza topping?"  </b>
